While I like to plan ahead my meals for the week, I dread the process of coming up with four to five dinners, as well as lunch mealprep ideas. Hence, every week anew I wish for an app that simply takes care of the planning for me. Behold - this is where `asparagusto`\* is meant to save the day!

From a technical point of view, I want to use this project as a practice ground for building a true fullstack application - with a dedicated UI, a proper domain, and a backend database and API service. My goal is to also deploy this on a Raspberry Pi server.

\*why the name? Simply, because asparagus is my girlfriend's favorite vegetable, and I am a sucker for play-on-words :)
